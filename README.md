# Multiplayer-Chess-Cpp
The two versions of chess that I made in first year of university. 

The [first version](https://github.com/AhsanAAR/Chess_Functional) uses c++ functional programming and all code is within a single file. Uses arrays, primitve data types and pointers. The GUI is implemented from scratch by printing block character (-37) on the console.

The [second version](https://github.com/AhsanAAR/chess_OOP) uses OOP design patterns like inheritence and polymorphism in cpp to distribute the codebase. It also uses the BGI library to draw the GUI.
